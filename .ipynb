    "Social media platforms are growing at an alarming rate, and with the current global pandemic, most jobs and social interactions have been pushed onto an online environment, leading to a surgical increase in online user activity within the past couple of months. This increase has caused significant delays of productivity both related to the limitations and restrictions placed on physical interactions and socialisation especially within Australia’s states and territories (Nguyen, 2020), and also due to the ongoing backlog of users attempting to gain access to electronic resources found within these social media platforms (Estes, 2020). To combat this, it is fundamental to understand and identify key attributes that correlate to the growth of these social media platforms in order to support them better, especially during these times of need. As part of this investigation, three unique models will be used to determine a suitable solution to this ongoing problem, especially since this overall increase in activity was due to the lockdowns of the Coronavirus pandemic. System dynamics, networks, and replicator dynamic models will be used in order to identify key characteristics to not only create and develop a probable solution, but to further assist these social media platforms as efficiently as possible."

    "By supporting the overall growth of these social media platforms, it will allow them to grow and develop their businesses to an extent whereby their values and features will focus more on their target audience rather than running for monetary value, which ultimately brings individuals together through an online webspace. From a mental point of view, by conducting this investigation, it will further assist the mental health of society at a global scale, due to the significant effects of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on physical interactions. Supporting the online ecosystem of major brands such as Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, or Microsoft Teams, will help compensate with advertising, estimating company growth, and support team sizes in order to positively impact individuals and society as a whole, which is ultimately the target goal of this investigation.

    "Within the social media industry, companies such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom have substantially increased in user activity within the recent months, most notably when the world paused its global productivity at the beginning of this year. Zoom in particular, was forced to expand their servers in various countries in order to keep up with the demands of the industry, increasing from 10 million daily meeting participants in December of 2019, to surpassing 300 million daily meeting participants in April of 2020 (Warren, 2020). However by doing so, Zoom also introduced risk factors such as security and privacy concerns related to the platform. The company responded with continuous updates to the application which not only addresses the aforementioned security and privacy issues, but also, according to The Verge, will be releasing version 5.0, which *“includes passwords by default, improved encryption, and a new security icon to control meetings.”* This update is the resulting outcome of the social media platform’s exponential growth, influenced by the increased numbers of taxpayers working from home due to the pandemic."

Discord will implement this feature, knowing that it will create performance instabilities and potential latency issues, yet this action directly creates a learning space for academics including schools and universities at a global scale which will undeniably allow Discord as a platform to further grow and essentially take advantage of the ‘learning at home’ situation that students and teachers currently face.

Due to the limiting factor of physical socialisation, such big brand social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok for example, have substantially increased in user activity ever since lockdown season began at the beginning of the year, and the government has released a bold statement with quote, *“Lockdown restrictions are slowing being lifted across Australia, but things have not returned to the old ‘normal’ yet and probably never will - more time online is likely to continue to be part of life.”* The quote follows with six helpful tips with online safety, including managing mental health, socialising online, dealing with cyberbullies, identifying reliable sources, online relationships, and balancing online time.

    "The major increase of engagement of social media platforms due to the automation of the future has allowed an opportunity for many models to address certain issues. Network models highlight the intercorrelation between two entities and how information is transferred to establish connections with one another. Social media platforms utilise network models through the online environment to create connections with peers and friends. Furthermore, social media growth can be measured through network models and the main types of network models. For example, small worlds demonstrate the connections and relationships between small groups of peers or community by the utilisation of social media platforms which provide additional support to establish small group chats and relationships. Furthermore, the high user engagement of online software’s and apps have been increased exponentially due to the corona virus pandemic. Therefore, social media platforms must deal with high user engagement to maintain a working information system. Moreover, social media platforms provide a crucial impact towards the marketing and advertising environment as it allows the promotion of products towards the consumers of social media. The replicator dynamic model suggests the adoption of strategy that is most likely to be chosen by the agent. The replicator dynamic model demonstrates the social media platform engagement of new users as most of the population with access to internet adapt the social media strategy."

Undeniably, social media platforms have major issues with maintenance and the constant need for website patches/bugs. However, socially due to the pandemic, territorial restrictions to physical gatherings have created an opportunity for social media platforms to engage in solving this issue. Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram all provide entertainment services for those stuck at home due to the restrictions. Big data refers to a high-volume amount of data that can be structured or even unstructured that need to be given meaning. Social media platforms deal with big data daily as there are large amounts of consumers daily. Furthermore, social media platforms provide educational purposes which is a significant benefit towards online schooling due to the corona virus pandemic. Models of social media can be demonstrated through social interaction and online interaction as they have their similarities and differences. Complex systems are related to social interactions and modelling such interactions can be difficult in nature."
